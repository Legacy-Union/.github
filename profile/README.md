# :wave:  The Legacy Union
Welcome to the Legacy Unions Github organization.
We are a supergroup of people who wish to re-create the Legacy Console Editions of Minecraft in Java edition, via the power of mods.

## :rocket:  Our Ideals
Our ideals consists of preferring Quality over Quantity in terms of our projects. Our most notable projects consist of Re-Console, and in partnership with Kyubion Studios, Legacy4J.
We also support FOSS software, seeking to use open source licenses, open source our configs (in the cases of modpacks), whilst making mods like Legacy4J open source.

We support this movement as a way to help everyone in the community wanting to fork, build off of, improve, etc. off our affiliated modpacks and mods.
